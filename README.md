Verified models receive normal write support. A firmware-reversed model can
expose only guarded writes with explicit acknowledgement while physical
validation is pending. A profile in the models/ directory is not a claim that
its controls work.

## Support matrix and implemented firmware paths

The firmware version below is the evidence used to implement the path. It is
not a promise that an untested firmware upgrade has the same behavior.

| Exact model (plugin) | Firmware evidence implemented | Available functions | Validation status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DX4600 / DX4600+ / DX4600 Pro (`dx4600`) | Official UGOS Pro `1.17.0.0095`, build `20260630.111337`, kernel `6.12.30+` | `sys` fan, AC recovery, WOL, scheduled wake | Firmware-reversed; no physical write validation. PWM is limited to `40..255`; writes need `--force --apply`. |
| DXP4800 Plus / DXP4800 Pro (`dxp4800plus`) | `1.17.0.95` | CPU/system fan readings and PWM, AC recovery, WOL, scheduled wake | Normal hwmon fan control and AC recovery are verified. Direct fallback, WOL, and scheduled wake still need `--force --apply`. |
| DXP4800 (`dxp4800`) | UGOS Pro `1.17.0.0095`, build `20260630.111337`, kernel `6.12.30+` | System fan, AC recovery, WOL, scheduled wake | Firmware-reversed; no physical write validation. Every write needs `--force --apply`. |
| DXP4800S (`dxp4800s`) | UGOS Pro `1.17.0.0095`, build `20260630.111337`, kernel `6.12.30+` | `sys` fan, AC recovery, WOL, scheduled wake | Firmware-reversed; no physical write validation. PWM is limited to `40..255`; writes need `--force --apply`. |
| DXP480T Plus (`dxp480tplus`) | UGOS Pro `1.17.0.95`, build `20260630.111337`, kernel `6.12.30+` | Fan readings, `cpu`/`all` PWM, AC recovery, WOL, scheduled wake | CPU writes have physical feedback. The corrected system-pair map, direct fallback, WOL, and scheduled wake await controlled physical validation. |
| DXP6800 Pro (`dxp6800pro`) | UGOS Pro `1.17.0.0095`, build `20260630.111337`, kernel `6.12.30+` | CPU/paired-system fans, AC recovery, WOL, scheduled wake | Firmware-reversed; no physical write validation. Every write needs `--force --apply`. |
| DXP2800 / DXP8800 Plus | none | Model detection only | No hardware-control command is implemented. |

Every operation requires an exact DMI match. No LED write protocol has been
implemented. The machine-readable [compatibility catalog](models/compatibility.json)
and [hardware support document](docs/HARDWARE_SUPPORT.md) are the authoritative
records of evidence and safeguards.

## Build

Build on an x86/x86_64 Linux host:

    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
    sudo cmake --install build

For a build-tree run, point the CLI at the generated plugins:

    ./build/ugreenctl --plugin-dir ./build/models models
    sudo ./build/ugreenctl --plugin-dir ./build/models info

## One-command scripts

Copy or clone the repository onto the Linux NAS, then run:

    sh ./scripts/install.sh --install-deps

This optionally installs the build prerequisites using the NAS package manager,
builds the project, and installs ugreenctl to /usr/local. Omit
--install-deps when CMake and a C compiler are already installed.

For a build-tree run without installing files:

    sh ./scripts/run.sh models
    sudo sh ./scripts/run.sh info
    sh ./scripts/run.sh fan set cpu 120
    sudo sh ./scripts/run.sh --apply fan set cpu 120

The last command is the only one that writes the fan register. The script
does not add --apply itself.

## CLI usage, inputs, and outputs

The general command form is:

```sh
ugreenctl [options] <command> [arguments]
```

Put every option before the command. The CLI identifies the NAS from its exact
DMI product name; `--model` selects a plugin but never spoofs the identity or
bypasses the match.

| Input | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--plugin-dir <dir>` | Directory containing the model plugins. Use `./build/models` with a build-tree binary; an installed binary uses its install-time default. |
| `--model <plugin-id>` | Select a discovered plugin explicitly, for example `dxp4800plus`. The exact local DMI name must still match. |
| `--apply` | Perform a write. Without it, every write command is only a preview. |
| `--force` | Acknowledge a firmware-reversed or experimental write path when that model requires it. It does not bypass the DMI, controller-owner, chip-ID, lock, or PWM-floor checks. |

| Command and input | Output on success |
| --- | --- |
| `models` | One line per plugin: `<plugin-id>  <display name>  <capabilities>`. No NAS hardware is accessed. |
| `info` | Selected model and controller, then startup/WOL policy and each available fan-status line. A partially unavailable read is reported as a warning on standard error. |
| `thermal status` | One machine-readable line: `cpu_celsius=<n> cpu_peak_celsius=<n> hdd_celsius=<n> ssd_celsius=<n>`. A value of `-1` means that source was unavailable. |
| `fan status` | One line per fan: `<fan-id>: pwm=<0-255|unknown> mode=<manual|auto|unknown> tach=<n> rpm=<n>`. |
| `fan set <fan-id> <pwm>` | `<pwm>` is an integer from `0` to `255`; accepted fan IDs depend on the exact model. The real write output is `<fan-id> fan PWM set to <pwm>`. |
| `power startup get` | `on`, `off`, `restore`, or `unknown`. |
| `power startup set <on|off|restore>` | `startup policy set to <policy>` after an applied write. `last` is accepted as an alias for `restore`. |
| `network wol get` | `on`, `off`, or `unknown`. |
| `network wol set <on|off>` | `Wake-on-LAN policy set to <policy>` after an applied write. |
| `power rtc-wake get` | Scheduled wake as a Unix epoch (UTC). |
| `power rtc-wake set <positive-unix-epoch>` | `RTC wake set to <epoch>` after an applied, forced write. |
| `power rtc-wake clear` | `RTC wake cleared` after an applied, forced write. |

`led list` is reserved in the command-line interface, but LED control has not
been verified for any model and currently returns an error.

Fan IDs are deliberately model-specific: DXP4800 Plus/Pro accepts `cpu` and
`sys`; DXP4800, DXP4800S, and DXP6800 Pro accept `sys` (DXP6800 Pro also
accepts `cpu`); and DXP480T Plus accepts `cpu` and `all`. Always start with
`fan status` on the exact NAS before choosing a target.

### Read, preview, then apply

```sh
# Read-only commands: their values are printed to standard output.
sudo ugreenctl info
sudo ugreenctl fan status
sudo ugreenctl power startup get
sudo ugreenctl network wol get

# Preview: succeeds without changing hardware.
ugreenctl fan set cpu 120
# dry-run: would set the fan PWM
# rerun with --apply to write hardware state

# Apply a normal verified write (root/CAP_SYS_RAWIO is normally required).
sudo ugreenctl --apply fan set cpu 120
# cpu fan PWM set to 120

# Firmware-reversed writes need the additional acknowledgement.
sudo ugreenctl --force --apply network wol set on
# Wake-on-LAN policy set to on
sudo ugreenctl --force --apply power rtc-wake set 1893452400
# RTC wake set to 1893452400
```

Successful commands exit with status `0`. Invalid input, an unsupported
feature, an unmatched model, a missing privilege, or a safety check failure
returns a non-zero status and writes a descriptive `error: ...` line to
standard error. Do not parse human-readable status text as a stable API; the
documented one-line `thermal status` output is the suitable compact status
format.

DXP4800S has one recovered `sysfan1` channel. The plugin calls it `sys`, and
exposes a guarded manual range of 40-255:

    sudo ugreenctl --force --apply fan set sys 120
    sudo ugreenctl --force --apply power startup set restore

DX4600, DX4600+, and DX4600 Pro use their own firmware-derived single-fan map
and the same guarded `sys` target. The three exact DMI names select the
`dx4600` plugin; prefix matching is not used:

    sudo ugreenctl --force --apply fan set sys 120
    sudo ugreenctl --force --apply power startup set restore
    sudo ugreenctl --force --apply network wol set on

The recovered `stock-4600` profile preserves the official daemon's effective
mode-2 thresholds and PWM points through `ugreenctl-fand`, while retaining the
project's non-stop safety floor. LED, beeper, and SATA MMIO operations are not
exposed.

On fnOS, WOL does not depend on a literal `eth0`/`eth1`. If both stock names
are absent, the DX4600 route enumerates physical PCI Ethernet adapters, rejects
virtual/bond/bridge devices, requires the official two-port topology, sorts by
PCI address, and verifies Magic Packet support and post-write state. Any other
physical-adapter count is rejected.

DXP6800 Pro is firmware-reversed and has not yet had a physical write
validation. It exposes the stock CPU path and the stock paired-system-fan path;
both still require `--force --apply`:

    sudo ugreenctl --force --apply fan set cpu 120
    sudo ugreenctl --force --apply fan set sys 120
    sudo ugreenctl --force --apply power startup set restore

`sys` sets both firmware-proven system PWM outputs with the same value. The
stock `hwmonitor` thermal curve is a user-space service, so it is not exposed
as a hardware automatic mode. The recovered register map and validation limits
are in [docs/DXP6800_PRO_REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md](docs/DXP6800_PRO_REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md).

The stock automatic mode is a user-space `hwmonitor` temperature daemon, not
an IT8613 hardware-auto switch. `ugreenctl-fand` is this project's guarded
software-curve replacement: it samples Linux temperatures and submits PWM
updates through `ugreenctl`. Its configuration inputs, invocation, and
machine-readable state-file output are documented in
[docs/FAN_CURVE.md](docs/FAN_CURVE.md).

Scheduled wake uses the firmware-derived Linux RTC path, not a BIOS or LED
register. It is available only for WOL-mapped exact models and needs
`--force --apply`; see
[docs/SCHEDULED_POWER_FIRMWARE_EVIDENCE.md](docs/SCHEDULED_POWER_FIRMWARE_EVIDENCE.md).

For DXP480T Plus, the `cpu` write path has physical feedback. The corrected
firmware-recovered `all` system-pair transaction still awaits controlled
physical validation. Normal hwmon writes require --apply and retain exact DMI
matching, the vendor-driver conflict guard, the IT8613 identity check, and the
PWM floor:

    sudo ugreenctl --apply fan set cpu 120
    sudo ugreenctl --apply fan set all 120

With hwmon present, the `all` target follows the vendor's two-system-fan
transaction in vendor order. When `it87` was intentionally unloaded and the
`it8613` hwmon node is absent, direct `cpu` uses control `0x17`, duty `0x73`;
direct `all` writes the system pair in order `0x16`/`0x6b`, then `0x1e`/`0x7b`.
Its three tachometers remain visible, but independent system-fan writes remain
hidden. The direct path refuses to run while any vendor interface or `it87` owns
the controller, checks chip identity and the process lock, and requires
`--force --apply`; physical validation of the corrected system-pair fallback is
still pending.

## Safety

- Every IT8613 plugin refuses to touch the controller while `/proc/it86`
  is active, avoiding concurrent register access.
- Each controller access takes an advisory lock at
  /run/ugreenctl-it8613.lock.
- Direct I/O requires root or CAP_SYS_RAWIO.
- Manual PWM disables hardware automatic control for that channel. DX4600 and
  DXP4800S stock automatic control is software-based, so stop or replace the
  stock daemon before manual use and keep temperatures independently monitored.

Before use outside UGREEN NAS firmware, unload the vendor module if it is
active:

    sudo modprobe -r ug_it86x_sio       # DX4600 / DXP4800S / DXP4800 branch
    sudo modprobe -r ug_it86x_cpufan    # DXP4800 Plus / DXP480T / DXP6800 branch

## Plugin ABI

Models may export the ABI version 3 entrypoint for fan-mode control and keep
the ABI version 2 entrypoint for compatibility:

    const struct ugreenctl_plugin *ugreenctl_plugin_v3(void);

    const struct ugreenctl_plugin *ugreenctl_plugin_v2(void);

The ABI is declared in include/ugreenctl.h. The core prefers ABI version 3,
falls back to ABI version 2, and discovers plugins by DMI product name or
--model.

## Maintaining compatibility

The machine-readable [compatibility catalog](models/compatibility.json) is the
release-facing record for every model. Before adding a plugin, follow the
[new-model intake template](docs/NEW_MODEL_TEMPLATE.md). In particular, use
exact DMI names, declare a support level, and record firmware evidence. Do not
promote a profile-only plugin to read-only or supported based on a similar
model.
